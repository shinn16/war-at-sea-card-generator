# Assets Folder

This folder contains the various assets used to generate the card faces including but not limited to: fonts, ship images,
card base images, nation-emblems, and other icons. 

It should be noted that **the font "B52-Regular" is not included in this repository**, but is referenced by the model definitions.
This is a paid font that I do not have the rights to redistribute, and given that this is a publicly available project, I 
can not include it as part of this project (The cards can be distributed with the font on them, only the font itself cannot be shared for reuse).
The font may be purchased at https://www.fonts.com/font/komet-flicker/bomber/regular.
If anyone knows of a font that is similar and is in the public domain, please feel free to recommend it. The only reason
this font was selected is due to how closely it resembled the font of the original cards.
